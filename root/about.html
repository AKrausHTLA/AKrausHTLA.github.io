    <h2>About Microtransactions</h2>
</div>

<div class= "text1">
    <p>Microtransactions are a business model that relies on the user purchasing virtual currencies/goods in the form of small payments. This model is typically used by free to play games
        in order to generate revenue, but it is sometimes also used by paid games to gain additional profit. Microtransactions have been highly profitable, as some of the highest grossing
        games in the world, such as League of Legends and Fortnite, make use of them.
    </p>
    <p>Since the games that feature microtransactions typically are free to play, developers will often employ predatory practices in order to easily compensate for the loss of revenue. Predatory practices
        are practices that involve developers manipulating their players with deceptive tactics in order to get them to spend more money. The most common form is one in which developers use a gambling mechanic
        where players will keep spending money on randomly generated loot drops until they get a rare reward. However, the most severe predatory practice tends to be one that involves a pay-to-win mechanic.
    </p>
    <p>Pay-to-win is a term used to describe the ability to spend money in order to gain an advantage in a game. This can take the form of locking powerful characters behind a paywall, allowing a player to purchase
        abilities, and creating a subscription that allows subscribers to gain a massively increased amount of resources, just to name a few.
    </p>
    <p>Many developers recently have been focusing on monetizing their game through cosmetics, which provide no in game advantage while still being profitable thanks to their appeal and the marketing
        strategies that developers use to sell them. This is usually done through first having the user acquire virtual currencies, which can then be spend on these cosmetic items.
