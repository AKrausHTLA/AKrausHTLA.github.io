    <h2>Microtransaction Types</h2>
</div>

<div class="type">
    <h2>Virtual Currencies</h2>
    <p>Virtual currencies are a type of microtransaction where players pay a certain amount of money to get a fake currency that can be spent on goods.
        These goods most commonly come in the forms of cosmetic items that change the appearance of a character or object, but can come in other forms such as
        unlocking characters, weapons, and items. Games that use virutal currencies will typically try to convince the player into buying larger sums of the currency
        by throwing in "bonus" currency for more expensive packages, thus rewarding players who spend more money.
    </p>
    <p>One example of this type of microtransaction can be found in Epic Games' Fortnite. In Fortnite, you can spend money on their virtual currency called "V-Bucks,"
        which can be bought in prices ranging from $7.99 to $79.99 USD (if bought in America). To incentivize you to buy more, they throw in an extra bonus into each of the
        higher tiers, with that bonus scaling up to 35% if you buy 13,500 V-Bucks for $79.99.
    </p>

    <p>You can then use V-Bucks to buy cosmetic items, which in this game includes skins, back blings, harvesting tools, emotes, and wraps. You may also use V-Bucks to buy
        a battle pass, which I will discuss later in the battle pass section. </p>

    <p>Despite being a free-to-play game, Fortnite generates on average $5 billion annually thanks to microtransactions.</p>
</div> 

<div class="type">
    <h2>Random Chance Purchases</h2>
    <p>Random chance purchases are a type of microtransaction where players pay for objects such as loot boxes are packs that contain randomly generated
        items. The process is very similar to gambling, as players will often buy many of these loot boxes until they get a jackpot, which in this case
        would usually be a rare item. Developers will typically accompany box openings with sound effects that escalate with the rarity of the item the
        user gets, causing a dopamine rush that makes the player want more. One game that uses this kind of microtransaction is Apex Legends. In order
        to incentivize you to buy loot boxes, Apex Legends has a system in which you will get a super rare virtual currency, "heirloom shards", if you
        open 500 "apex packs". They also guarantee a rare legendary cosmetic after 30 apex packs. This makes the player want to get more knowing that
        if they don't get lucky then they'll at least get a guaranteed rare item eventually.
    </p>

    <img src="https://www.slythergames.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Heirloom-Shard-Packs.jpg" alt="Heirloom Shards" class="image">
    <p> The first image shows an apex pack with a red glow that is emitted when it is about to reveal heirloom rarity loot. The second image shows a player
        receiving heirloom shards from an apex pack. Because of its microtransactions, Apex Legends has been rapidly approaching an annual revenue of $1 billion,
        which is impressive considering it is also a free-to-play game.
    </p>

<div class="type">
    <h2>Battle Passes</h2>
    <p>Battle passes are a type of microtransaction where players get access to a track of rewards that are earned by leveling up through the pass. Experience to level
        up is acquired by playing games and completing challenges. These challenges are tasks given to players that require some action to be taken in a game, such as 
        getting a certain amount of eliminations or playing a certain amount of matches. Gaming companies typically manipulate players by proving a free reward track that
        has significantly less rewards with significantly less quality. This incentivizes players to buy the paid version of the pass which typically has a reward at each level
        along with much higher quality rewards, such as more unique and interesting cosmetics. One game that utilizes this kind of microtransaction is Blizzard Entertainment's 
        Overwatch 2. In Overwatch 2, players automatically have a free battle pass with very few rewards and low-quality skins. Upon purchasing the premium battle pass, you get 
        access to cool skins automatically along with access to more interesting loot throughout the entire pass. They also provide an experience bonus to make it easier to complete 
        the pass, along with occasionally puttng a hero unlock in the pass which is instantly unlocked in the premium pass but is unlocked at a late level in the free pass. 
    </p>

    <p> This image shows a picture of the Overwatch 2 Season 1 Battle Pass. There are only 3 free unlocks availabe on that page of the pass, while there are 7 premium unlocks, with many of
        those unlocks being more sought-after rewards such as legendary skins, emotes, and highlight intros. Tier 55 offers a hero unlock of the season's latest hero, Kiriko. Players who didn't 
        spend money would have to spend a large portion of the season grinding for that hero, while players who paid for the pass unlocked Kiriko immediately. Overwatch 2 earned $100 million
        in its first three months after becoming a free-to-play game with microtransactions.

<div class="type">
    <h2>Plot Progression</h2>
    <p>One more niche type of microtransaction is plot progression, which is a type of microtransaction where the player is required to spend money in order to continue progressing through the story through the game. Additionally,
        there are some circumstances where it isn't required to spend money, but you have to wait a very long time to continue playing unless you do spend money. For example, there are many
        mobile interactive story games that stop your progression while you play, prompting you to either wait several hours or pay a premium currency to continue playing. They will also lock
        certain choices in the game behind paywalls, with these choices typically being more desirable.
    </p>
    <img src="https://media.pocketgamer.biz/2018/1/85519/choices-diamond-decision-r471x.jpg" alt="Choices" class="image">
    <p>This image shows a part of a story where you're prompted to make a choice: save Prince Tevan's life, swear to avenge his death, or run before it's too late.
        The best option in this case would be to save Prince Tevan's life, as that would have the best reprecussions for the story, but you have to pay 12 "diamonds"
        in order to do so. Some games offer this premium currency for free, but that currency typically comes in extremely limited quantities, just enough to get you to feel 
        more inclined to spend money to continue reaping those benefits for a longer period of time.
    </p>

<div class="type">
    <h2>XP Boosters</h2>
    <p>XP Boosters are a type of microtransaction where the player can spend money to instantly unlock experience or increase the rate at which they increase experience for a certain
        amount of time. These are really useful for saving the player time, but they tend to come at the reprucission of being pay-to-win as the best players can to much higher levels 
        faster by buying XP Boosters. One example of this can be found in Supercell's Clash of Clans. In Clash of Clans, the player levels up their town hall, their troops, and other buildings
        around their base in order to become more and more powerful. Leveling up buildings and structures can take a long time, but by buying the premium currency, you can level everything up
        instantly. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://clashguideswithdusk.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screenshot_2020-04-12-19-54-30-15_b864ea0b534de5941fd13c5c04397e2b.jpg?w=1024" alt="Finish Upgrade" class="image">
    <p>In this image, the player is prompted to pay 39 "gems" in order to finish upgrading their gold mine. This wait would've taken several hours, but by spending money,
        the player was able to save that time and they were able to start upgrading something else. This system makes it really easy to profit off of players as nobody wants to 
        spend hours waiting when they could just do it all much faster. Supercell reported generating close to $496 million from their Clash of Clans microtransaction sales in 2022.
    </p>

<div class="type">
    <h2>Consumable Items</h2>
    <p>Consumable items are a type of microtransaction where the player can spend money to unlock an item that they can use one time to gain a certain benefit, such as an increased production
        of resources or temporary access to VIP status. These are very popular in ARPGs, where grinding is very prominent so it is extremely helpful to have paid benefits. This can be seen in 
        Smilegate's Lost Ark, where the player can spend "gems" to buy Crystalline Aura.
    </p>
    <img src="https://fayiette.com/wp-content/uploads/gaming/lostark/lost-ark-crystalline-aura.webp" alt="Crystalline Aura" class="image" height="800" width="600">
    <p>This Crystalline Aura serves as a VIP status that grants the user several benefits for 30 days. The overall theme of this benefits is to save time for the player,
        which, as mentioned before, is an extremely appealing trait of an item to have in a game that involves so much grinding. Lost Ark made 1.4345 trillion South Korean won in 2021, 
        which is approximately 1 million USD.
    </p>
</div> 

<div class="type">
    <h2>Memberships</h2>
    <p>Memberships are a type of microtransaction similar to the VIP status seen in consumable items where you can buy a premium subscription for a set amount of time in order to get a large
        amount of benefits. Free-to-play games that have memberships are typically much harder to play for non-members. This increased level of difficulty makes it much more likely that a player
        that sticks to the game for a long time decides to become a member. One example of this can be seen in CCP Games' EVE Online. In EVE Online, all players start as Alpha members and can optionally
        become Omega members in order to gain a host of benefits.
    </p>
    <img src="images/omega-alpha.jpg" alt="EVE Memberships" class="image">
    <p>In this image, Omega is showcased as a full access premium subscription that offers a large amount of benefits, with the common theme being expanding access to certain aspects of the game
        and making the game much easier to play through. As a free-to-play game, EVE Online has generated $66 million in revenue in 2011.
