<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 1 (Week of December 25, 2022):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (December 29): I Started learning about web programming by exploring the web programming part of CS50x, 
        Week 8 of Harvard's Online Introduction to Computer Science course. I watched their lecture about the 
        internet and its primary programming languages: HTML (basic structure of the website), CSS (design of the website), 
        and JavaScript (interactivity/behavior of the website), then I watched other supplementary videos provided.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (December 30): I completed the CS50x Week 8 Lab assignment, which had me create my own simple trivia website that 
        prompted the user to answer one multiple choice (three options) question and one free response question and then 
        provide the user with feedback that would tell them if they got the answer correct or incorrect. I also did some 
        additional optional work on the assignment, including modifying the already given CSS to slightly personalize the website. 
    </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 2 (Week of January 1, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (January 2): After reading about the CS50x Week 8 Problem Set assignment, which had me create a simple homepage and some other 
        parts of a website to accommodate it, I decided to start making an early version of my senior project website to fulfill the assignment 
        requirements. I began by imagining what the top of my homepage would look like by experimenting with different designs. Eventually, 
        I was able to figure out how to create an interactive navigation bar to let the user quickly switch between pages.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (January 3): I continued working on my homepage, starting by figuring out how to fill up some space to cap it all off. I decided on an 
        image of an example of microtransactions, along with a caption to introduce the reader to my website. I then learned more about CSS and 
        web design (specifically about changing colors and fonts) in order to set a general design for my website, with me going for a more 
        grayscale vibe along with a sans-serif font for my text. I then finished my day by setting margins and padding for the text and image on my homepage.
    </p>
    <p>Day 3 (January 4): I started working on my About Microtransactions page, which was much easier to make now that I had a good foundation from Day 2. I wrote 
        up some text to talk about microtransactions in general and then I put it on the page. I spent some time experimenting with margins as well, I wasn't 
        able to find something that worked for mobile devices but I was satisfied with the design for larger desktop displays. I finished off my day by figuring 
        out how to connect my two pages through the navigation bar, which I succeeded in doing. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 4 (January 5): I started working on my Microtransaction Types page. I did some research on different types of microtransactions, then spent some time figuring 
        out what I would want to say about each type. I then started writing my first section about virtual currencies. As I was writing, I ended up deciding to get 
        rid of my plans to make a separate page about highlighting certain company practices, and instead, I included examples of microtransactions from different games 
        to explain each type of microtransaction. I was able to finish researching for and then writing about the first two sections. I then worked on the CSS of this page 
        to set margins for my text and images, along with making certain text choices like bolding the section titles.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 3 (Week of January 29, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (January 29): I started working on my Senior Survey, brainstorming ideas for what questions I could ask and what I would like to achieve through this survey.</p>
    <p>Day 2 (January 30): I continued working on my Senior Survey, creating the first few questions related to asking users about their favorite genres and how much money they 
        spend on games.
    </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 4 (Week of February 19, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (February 20): I continued working on my Senior Survey, brainstorming questions I could ask about the player experience and spending on free-to-play games. </p>
    <p>Day 2 (February 22): I started writing my questions for my Senior Survey about the free-to-play experience, allowing me to become about halfway complete with the first 
        version of my Senior Survey. I also met with Mr. Ramirez to share my plans going forward with my senior project along with my current progress in the survey and 
        on my website.
    </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 5 (Week of February 26, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (February 27): I discovered that my codespace was deleted by GitHub, causing me to lose all of my current progress on my website. I then began planning my steps going 
        forward with getting back on track with my senior project, deciding that I should still focus on getting my Senior Survey out before I start up my website again.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (March 1): I added a few more questions to the half of my survey about free-to-play spending and I formatted my survey to be physically split into several sections, 
        each with its own instructions to make the survey easier to fill out. I then began brainstorming questions for my pay-to-play section.
    </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 6 (Week of March 12, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (March 13): I continued working on my survey, working on several questions in the pay-to-play section that reflected my thoughts about how I could include microtransactions 
        in a general field that isn't as reliant on them along with showing how I could compare spending habits in free-to-play games to those in pay-to-play and buy-to-play games. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (March 15): I continued my work from March 13th, ultimately finishing up my survey. I ended up adding an end-of-survey section in addition to finishing my paid game section 
        which asked participants to provide me with feedback about my survey.
    </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 7 (Week of March 19, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (March 22): I reviewed and edited my survey with the help of Mr. Nazaryan, then I sent out my survey as a pilot study to just my English class.</p>
    <p>Day 2 (March 25): I analyzed the data collected from my pilot study. One thing I noticed was that analyzing the data for my questions that ask people to rank several items in 
        order is kind of confusing since the data is just all over the place for those questions. However, I generally found the data to be much easier to understand than anticipated 
        so I doubt I'll need to make any major changes to my survey. Most of my feedback was just about how long my survey was, but I don't plan on shortening it since I want all of 
        the data that I asked for in the survey. As per request, I added JRPGs to my list of genres and I added a question asking about how much money combined people spend on all 
        video games, regardless of type.
    </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 8 (Week of April 2, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (April 3): I started working on my website once again, recreating the basic form of my website's homepage and navigation bar. I also did research on the internet 
        to help me re-learn how to code in HTML and CSS in order to help me recreate my website to the best of my ability. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (April 4): I started working on my About page, using sources I saved to write up some paragraphs about microtransactions. I also learned how to use hrefs to reference 
        other pages of my website on one page, allowing my navigation bar to take the user to any page on the website. I was able to finish the basic form of my About page.
    </p>
    <p>Day 3 (April 5): I started working on the microtransaction types page of my website. After working all day, I was able to recreate a basic form of my page with the help of 
        sources I used for my research in the previous version of my website.  I then did more research on CSS, learning how to use divisions to place each description in its own 
        colored box, allowing me to add some more style to my page. I also learned more about how to adapt the size of an image according to the computer I was on to help keep my 
        images well-sized across all of the devices I was viewing my website from. I was able to do this with the help of the CSS feature @media screen. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 4 (April 6): I started working on the survey portion of my website, doing research into ways I can implement my survey data. I started off by planning on just implementing 
        images of my survey and writing paragraphs to accommodate those images, but I then had the idea of using JavaScript to make new interactive charts that showcase my data instead. 
        After doing some research as to how to make interactive pie charts and how to implement them properly in a website, I got to work. I ended up running into an issue where my pie 
        chart wouldn't appear on my website, and after an hour of debugging, I finally found that I simply wasn't implementing the window.onload function in my JavaScript file, which is 
        what I needed to get the chart to load properly. I finished off my day by successfully making a pie chart that displays how many players play free-to-play games and how many players 
        play buy-to-play games. I also centered it in the middle of my page.
    </p>
    <p>Day 5 (April 7): I continued working on the survey portion of my website, learning how to implement additional JavaScript charts on my website so I could fit all of my data. While 
        working on the page, I noticed that I had an extra question that I added later on that I never gave to the students in my pilot study, causing that question to have inaccurate data 
        as the sample size differed from my other questions. I left the chart with the data from that question alone and I continued to work on the website. I finished off the day by learning 
        how to make bar charts with JavaScript, then I added my first bar chart to the survey page. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 6 (April 8): I continued working on the survey portion of my website, starting off by finishing all of the bar charts in the free-to-play section of my survey. I ended up reaching 
        over 500 lines of code in my javascript file containing all of my charts, so I decided to learn how to split the code into two different files. I struggled at first as simply creating 
        another file, splitting the code, and referring to both of the files in my code didn't work. However, after I spent some time doing research, I found that I could only run window.onload 
        in one of the files. Implementing this change allowed me to successfully split my javascript files into two: one for pie charts and one for bar charts. I then continued working, finishing 
        off the remainder of the free-to-play section of my survey.
    </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 9 (Week of April 9, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (April 9): I continued working on the survey portion of my website, creating the entire buy-to-play section along with writing up sentences to accommodate my data. After finishing up 
        writing the code for this section, I did a final grammar and spelling review for my text along with a check for how the page looked on my school computer, which is where I plan on presenting 
        the website. I made the necessary changes after doing these checks, and then I finally finished the survey portion of my website.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (April 10): I started working on the developer blog portion of my website, ultimately creating a plain blog that has independent elements for my header, section headers, and paragraphs. 
        Once I finished this plain version of the blog, I decided to look into how I could improve it. I ended up deciding on making each section collapsible using JavaScript, which is something I 
        planned on implementing later in the week. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 3 (April 12): I continued working on the developer blog portion of my website, successfully implementing the JavaScript collapsible sections for each week of content on my blog. I did 
        initially have an issue with one of the weeks not expanding to its full size, but after some time spent debugging, I was able to solve the issue by removing an extra close header tag that I 
        accidentally included. After getting the collapsible sections working as intended, I started working on the style for the collapsible sections. I settled on black text boxes similar to the 
        boxes in my microtransaction types page, with the minimized portion of the textbook becoming gray when the section is hovered or becomes active. I then decided to finish up the style for my 
        collapsible sections by adding a border to each collapsible section in order to make it easier to differentiate between each section. Later in the day, I decided to start thinking about ways 
        I could improve my homepage. I ended up deciding on putting the image I had in the background of my page, then blurring that image and adding a low-opacity black layer over it in order to add 
        more contrast between the image and the text above it. I finished up by adding a new font for the text on that page, which happens to be a little easter egg as it is the same font that Overwatch 
        used to use for their shop page, just not italicized.
