<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 1 (Week of December 25, 2022):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (December 29): I Started learning about web programming by exploring the web programming part of CS50x, 
        Week 8 of Harvard's Online Introduction to Computer Science course. I watched their lecture about the 
        internet and its primary programming languages: HTML (basic structure of the website), CSS (design of the website), 
        and JavaScript (interactivity/behavior of the website), then I watched other supplementary videos provided.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (December 30): I completed the CS50x Week 8 Lab assignment, which had me create my own simple trivia website that 
        prompted the user to answer one multiple choice (three options) question and one free response question and then 
        provide the user with feedback that would tell them if they got the answer correct or incorrect. I also did some 
        additional optional work on the assignment, including modifying the already given CSS to slightly personalize the website. 
    </p>

<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (January 2): After reading about the CS50x Week 8 Problem Set assignment, which had me create a simple root and some other 
        parts of a website to accommodate it, I decided to start making an early version of my senior project website to fulfill the assignment 
        requirements. I began by imagining what the top of my root would look like by experimenting with different designs. Eventually, 
        I was able to figure out how to create an interactive navigation bar to let the user quickly switch between pages.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (January 3): I continued working on my root, starting by figuring out how to fill up some space to cap it all off. I decided on an 
        image of an example of microtransactions, along with a caption to introduce the reader to my website. I then learned more about CSS and 
        web design (specifically about changing colors and fonts) in order to set a general design for my website, with me going for a more 
        grayscale vibe along with a sans-serif font for my text. I then finished my day by setting margins and padding for the text and image on my root.
    </p>
    <p>Day 3 (January 4): I started working on my About Microtransactions page, which was much easier to make now that I had a good foundation from Day 2. I wrote 
        up some text to talk about microtransactions in general and then I put it on the page. I spent some time experimenting with margins as well, I wasn't 
        able to find something that worked for mobile devices but I was satisfied with the design for larger desktop displays. I finished off my day by figuring 
        out how to connect my two pages through the navigation bar, which I succeeded in doing. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 4 (January 5): I started working on my Microtransaction Types page. I did some research on different types of microtransactions, then spent some time figuring 
        out what I would want to say about each type. I then started writing my first section about virtual currencies. As I was writing, I ended up deciding to get 
        rid of my plans to make a separate page about highlighting certain company practices, and instead, I included examples of microtransactions from different games 
        to explain each type of microtransaction. I was able to finish researching for and then writing about the first two sections. I then worked on the CSS of this page 
        to set margins for my text and images, along with making certain text choices like bolding the section titles.

    <p>Day 1 (January 29): I started working on my Senior Survey, brainstorming ideas for what questions I could ask and what I would like to achieve through this survey.</p>
    <p>Day 2 (January 30): I continued working on my Senior Survey, creating the first few questions related to asking users about their favorite genres and how much money they 
        spend on games.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 4 (Week of February 19, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (February 20): I continued working on my Senior Survey, brainstorming questions I could ask about the player experience and spending on free-to-play games. </p>
    <p>Day 2 (February 22): I started writing my questions for my Senior Survey about the free-to-play experience, allowing me to become about halfway complete with the first 
        version of my Senior Survey. I also met with Mr. Ramirez to share my plans going forward with my senior project along with my current progress in the survey and 
        on my website.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 5 (Week of February 26, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (February 27): I discovered that my codespace was deleted by GitHub, causing me to lose all of my current progress on my website. I then began planning my steps going 
        forward with getting back on track with my senior project, deciding that I should still focus on getting my Senior Survey out before I start up my website again.
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (March 1): I added a few more questions to the half of my survey about free-to-play spending and I formatted my survey to be physically split into several sections, 
        each with its own instructions to make the survey easier to fill out. I then began brainstorming questions for my pay-to-play section.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Week 6 (Week of March 12, 2023):</button>
<div class="content">
    <p>Day 1 (March 13): I continued working on my survey, working on several questions in the pay-to-play section that reflected my thoughts about how I could include microtransactions 
        in a general field that isn't as reliant on them along with showing how I could compare spending habits in free-to-play games to those in pay-to-play and buy-to-play games. 
    </p>
    <p>Day 2 (March 15): I continued my work from March 13th, ultimately finishing up my survey. I ended up adding an end-of-survey section in addition to finishing my paid game section 
        which asked participants to provide me with feedback about my survey.
